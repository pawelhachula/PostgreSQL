# **PostgreSQL**

## Project description
In this repository I present my database and SQL project. The project consists of 4 tasks. The tasks come from the "Databases, SQL for testers and analysts" course.

The project was translated into English, but some names remained in Polish.


 
## Exercise 1

Create a **phones** table that will have the following 5 fields:
- phone_id [primary key]
- brand 
- model 
- year
- color


## Exercise 2

To the previously created table **telephones**, upload 5 example full records.


## Exercise 3

From the **phones** table created in the previous tasks, display only those that are white and are not older than 4 years (2019) and are not iPhones. Sort them last by model in reverse alphabetical order (from 'z' to 'a').


## Exercise 4

Design 3 tables: **uczniowie, nauczyciele, klasy**. Fill them with sample data - in particular, **5 records** in each table. Compare music table with at least **6 columns**. Design the table to accomplish the following task:

**DISPLAY THE NAMES OF THE 4TH GRADE STUDENTS TAUGHT BY THE TEACHER NAMED 'NOWAK'.**
